                    Suhora has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with
                    Thiagarajar College of Engineering, Madurai, to strengthen
                    industry-academia collaboration. This partnership aims to
                    equip students with industry-relevant skills and expose them
                    to real-world challenges in the geospatial and space
                    technology domains. As part of the MoU, Suhora will deliver
                    specialized industrial training, offer internships, and
                    collaborate on research projects, providing students with
                    hands-on experience and opportunities in the growing Indian
                    space sector. This initiative marks a significant step
                    toward developing STEM professionals who will contribute to
                    India's Geospatial Economy and accomplish the Indian Space
                    Dream.
